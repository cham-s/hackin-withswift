Hacking with swift

Except for Challenges I submit, code source from Projects are part of a series of tutorial written by Paul Hudson, there might be slight changes but most of the code comes from the tutorials.

Challenges comes from the Book Guide for those who bought the book to support his amazing work.

Other than that the book is free. Basically you can learn Swift and how to become an iOS developer for free.
